On-skin interfaces demonstrate great potential given their direct skin contact; however, conducting field studies of these devices outside of laboratories and in real settings remains a challenge. We conduct a research-through-design investigation using an extended woven practice for fabricating fully-integrated and untethered multi-sensor on-skin systems that are resilient, versatile, and capable of field deployment. We designed, implemented, and deployed a woven on-skin index-finger and thumb-based inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensing system for multi-hour use as a *technology probe* to understand the social, technical, and design facets towards moving integrated on-skin systems into a wearer’s daily life. Further, we integrate a woven NFC coil into the IMU on skin system, which is wirelessly powered by a smartwatch substitute, signifying the potential of our woven approach for developing wirelessly powered on-skin systems for longer-term continuous wear. Our investigation and the lessons learned shed light on the opportunities for designing on-skin systems for everyday wear.
