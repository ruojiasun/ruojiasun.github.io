Weaving possesses the structural and aesthetic capacities for creating soft, wearable forms that support technological integration and self-expression. We extend a woven approach for fabricating on-skin interfaces, slim, skin-conformable devices that allow seamless interaction on the skin surface. In contrast to previous film-based fabrication methods, the unique structures of weaving support robust multi-functional devices, electrical connections between device layers, and integration of novel materials. We illustrate the functional and design space of woven on-skin interfaces through a series of case studies. We also conduct 2 user studies to understand device wearability and feasibility for textiles practitioners to create personalized on-skin interfaces using our approach.
