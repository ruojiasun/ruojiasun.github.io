## Overview

Naive Bayes is a supervised learning approach for probabilistic classification, applying Bayes’ theorem to assign class labels to vectors of features. Like other supervised learning algorithms, naive Bayes models are trained with labeled data in order to predict values of a target attribute for new data vectors. It makes a (naive) assumption of independence between features (attributes). Naive Bayes computes in linear time, making it highly scalable and suitable for classifying large datasets and performs well if the independence condition holds. Naive Bayes is based on Bayes’ theorem, which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions.

Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class prediction, and is implemented in applications such as text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems. There are various types of naive Bayes classifiers. Multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) is used for data vectors with features that have two or more variables (for example, a marital status feature with values of married, single and divorced). In MNB, the data features are multinomially distributed, which means they represent probability distributions for events that have two or more possible outcomes. The decision rule for multinomial naive Bayes is:
