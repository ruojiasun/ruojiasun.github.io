Hi, I'm Ruojia. I am a researcher at heart, with 4+ years of experience in quantitative and qualitative academic research on human-computer interaction. As such, I am driven by a deep curiosity to learn about the world. I focus on asking the right questions, applying my technical skills and creative thinking to deliver insights on complex problems, and telling impactful stories of the results.​
​

I am seeking full-time data analyst and UX researcher positions. In May 2024, I completed my M.S. in Creative Technology & Design at the University of Colorado Boulder, where my funded research focused on technology for dance, movement, and wellness. Previously, I received my B.S. and M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University. I also apply my enthusiasm for learning and taking on new challenges to dance, baking, and social justice issues.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
